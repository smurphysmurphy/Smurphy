Her sound is influenced by 90s electronic styles and bass music, been ranked in the best releases of the year in Pitchfork, SPIN, Tinymixtapes and other, been recognized as a top performer in Mutek.</div> </div> <div class="t-col t-col_8" style="margin:0; float:none; display:inherit;"><div class="t210__text t-text t-text_md" field="text" style="font-size:17px;">In 2011, she joined the rare acid house duo, Supermad. This project ended with "DJ Smurphy"'s <em>Nightwaves</em> single, influenced by the Footwork music of Chicago. Then, Jessica moved to Mexico City's downtown, adopted the DJ Smurphy name, and started DJing underground parties. Shortly after starting, she joined the NAAFI crew and started producing music influenced by her favorite 90s electronic styles like eurodance, garage, jungle, happy hardcore, and other underground styles like dubstep, footwork, jersey club, dancehall...<br /><br /><br />In 2013, Smurphy put out #<em>Smurphwave</em> EP, produced by Lao and released by MALIGNA<em>,</em> an apocalyptic dubby melt of female gibberish, ghetto bass and heavy percussion. In 2014, she released <em>#Geminiss</em> EP v√≠a NAAFI, with an eclectic techno and bass sound, fully produced by Jessica. While keeping her career as a graphic designer for television advertisement agencies, she made music and DJed late at night and on weekends. In 2015, she moved to Los Angeles, CA and released "<em>A Shapeless Pool of Lovely Pale Colours Suspended in the Darkness"</em> via Leaving Records, an album that was ranked in the best releases of the year in Tinymixtapes, Pitchfork, and SPIN.<br /><br /><br />In 2017, after returning to Mexico, she briefly changed her name to Upgrayedd Smurphy and released <em>"Hypnosys"</em> under her net label R-chv (confounded with her partner D/P/I). This album was a sprawling journey through jagged techno, avant drum 'n' bass and glitchy atmospherics. Later that year, she released <em>"Sorry, Please Forgive Me, Thank You, I Love You"</em>, a healing dance EP. In this short year, she also performed at Mutek Montreal and Mutek Mexico, and was recognized as a top performer.<br /><br /><br />Jessica was open about suffering chronic pain, and by the end of 2017, she discovered she had a spinal birth defect called Spina Bifida Occulta, which was causing health complications. This was devastating because she was already feeling very weak when performing live, touring or just trying to be as productive as she was used to. Regardless, she continued performing and in 2018 she released <em>#PENINSULA</em>, an album of hectic house, techno and EDM rhythms, inspired by the expression of dancing, having lost mobility for some time. By 2019, she stopped making music and performing to focus 100% on her health.<br /><br /><br />In 2020 she returned with the EP <em>"Spheres of Consciousness",</em> released by Bokeh Versions. Later that year she produced a series of collaborative dancehall singles with Duppy Gun crew, releasing several riddims with Ijahbar, G Sudden, King Kush, and other Jamaican singers. Finnally on the summer of 2021, she released her last album RIP Smurphy Forever, retiring as Smurphy and announcing her new art project Ileana Magoda.<br />--<br /><br />Born in Iztapalapa and raised in Estado de Mexico, both at the outskirts of the enormous Mexico City, Mexico. Smurphy had an inclination towards music from an early age, she was always fascinated by electronic music and loved to sing, dance and make her own mixtapes on cassette. She joined her school bands where she learned to sing, play marimba, drums, and other instruments, and her music teachers endorsed her to go to music school. It was economically difficult to attend music school, so she opted for studying graphic design instead. In 2007, months from receiving her degree, she dropped out of college and started working as a designer, which gave her access to a Mac computer and high-speed internet, both tools that she would need to achieve her music dreams.<br /><br /></div> </div></div></div></div></div></div><!--/allrecords-->
